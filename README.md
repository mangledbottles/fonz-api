# Fonz API
Express Node.js backend API for Fonz Application.
- This project is the prototype for our upcoming app, Fonz. 
- Fonz's mission is to simplify queueing music on other people's devices and platforms when you are in close proximity. 
- It will be configured with a physical NFC tag, which we refer to as a coaster.
