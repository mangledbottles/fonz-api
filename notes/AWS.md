#### Creating an Amazon Machine Image
- After you install Node.js on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from that instance. 
- Creating an AMI makes it easy to provision multiple Amazon EC2 instances with the same Node.js installation. For more information about creating an AMI from an existing instance, see Creating an Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

#### 3rd Party Sign-in
- Users have created accounts with Google, Apple, Anonymous
- Google and Apple sign in are done through an affiliated developer account
  - That affiliated developer is Google....

#### Github Auto-Deploy to AWS
- All changes to the API will be done in a **new branch**
- Once this branch is turned into a PR and approved, it is merged into the master branch
- Looking into the possibility of using GitHub *releases* to manage redeployment
- Otherwise, whenever there is a change to main, using GH WorkFlows, deploy the new API on AWS

#### Moving from Firebase to AWS
- There are a lot of changes happening with how the API is managed

**Currently** 
| Function | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Database|  [GCP](#gcp) Firebase Firestore NoSQL |
| Server | [GCP](#gcp) Firebase Serverless Functions |

**Future** 
| Function | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Database|  [AWS](#aws) Multi-Region MySQL RDS Aurora Serverless |
| Server | [AWS](#aws) Multi-Region EC2 scaling with AMI |

## Scrypt
- Scrypt is a "password-based key derivation function".
- Real passwords are **NEVER** stored, they are **hashed** (also using a random salt to make them unique) so user accounts are *safe*
- Google Firebase Authentication uses Scrypt, might use a different hashing mechanism.. tbd
